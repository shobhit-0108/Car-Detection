# Car-Detection
In this Project we will devise a model that will detect a car in just one look. This Model is one of the most important subject in self driven car


"You Only Look Once" (YOLO) is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.
